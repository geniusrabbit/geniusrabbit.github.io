🌍 The **Open SSP Server** team is attending the **TES Affiliate Conference** in **Seville** this year — and we’re looking forward to connecting with partners, clients, and innovators in the performance marketing space.

### Why Meet Us at TES?

We’re building a powerful and flexible **Server-Side Platform (SSP)** tailored for today’s evolving programmatic advertising market. Our focus is on:

- 🔄 **Real-Time Bidding (RTB)** infrastructure that enables high-speed, transparent, and configurable monetization pipelines
- 🧩 A fully customizable ecosystem with pluggable components for traffic filtering, targeting, and analytics
- 📊 A new **control panel** for managing websites, RTB sources, ad spots, and routing logic — all in real-time

Whether you're a **publisher**, **DSP**, **ad network**, or **traffic aggregator**, our platform can support your business with scalable architecture and deep customization capabilities.

### What is Open SSP Server?

Open SSP Server is a lightweight and extensible RTB platform designed to simplify the way traffic is monetized. It includes:

- A robust RTB request/response handler
- Flexible traffic routing logic
- Integration-ready APIs and event streams
- Real-time stats and performance insights (in progress)
- A clean, intuitive control panel (now in early access)

The system is ideal for teams looking to take control over their ad tech stack, reduce dependency on third-party black boxes, and build proprietary optimization strategies.

### Let’s Talk Collaboration

We’re currently looking to partner with:

- RTB demand partners and DSPs
- Publishers and traffic resellers
- Technology providers in analytics, fraud detection, and optimization
- Agencies and platforms seeking infrastructure independence

Whether you want to integrate with our bidding ecosystem, run your own instance of the server, or build something custom on top — we’re open to dialogue.

📅 **TES in Seville is a great chance to meet face-to-face.**

📩 Drop us a message in advance to book a time, or just find us at the event — we’ll be happy to demo the platform and explore how we can work together.

**See you in Seville!**
