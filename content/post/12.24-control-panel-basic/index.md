We’re excited to announce that development is underway on the **Control Panel for Open SSP Server** — a powerful interface for managing the key components of your advertising infrastructure.

### What’s Available Now

The **basic version of the control panel** already allows management of critical elements in your SSP stack:

- 🛰 **RTB Sources** — configure and manage real-time bidding endpoints  
- 🌍 **Websites** — manage publisher sites and associated metadata  
- 🎯 **Ad Spots** — define and edit placement rules and formats  
- ⚙️ **System Settings** — set core options for your traffic and logic handling

This foundational layer enables essential operations and integration without needing direct access to APIs or databases.
